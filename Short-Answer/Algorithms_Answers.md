Exercise I

a. Runtime is constant Time 0(n) because in the case of n=0, the number of operations would change

b. O(n^4) because there are 4 nested loops 

c. 0(c) because regardless of the number of bunnies, the number of operations will remain the same, even in the case of 0

Exercise II
Questions: 
1. Does this question include real-world physics logic?

Since it is reasonable to assume an egg will be broken quite easily, it would be most effective to start from floor 1.

def egg_break_threshhold(f):
    floor == []
    f == 0
    egg_status == 1

    while egg_status == 1:
        floor[f]
        egg_status = Math.random(0,1)
        
        if egg_status == 1:
            f++
            print('this egg is strong')
        else:
            print('egg broken at {f} floor')

    0(c) - constant time because depending on the outcome of egg broken on the first floor, extra operations would have to be used.
